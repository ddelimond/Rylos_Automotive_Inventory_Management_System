  <h4>Our Mission</h4>
  <p>At Rylo's Automotive, our mission is to keep Columbus moving with integrity, expertise, and genuine care. We believe that every vehicle tells a story—of morning commutes, family road trips, first dates, and new beginnings—and we're honored to be the guardians of those journeys. We provide honest, transparent automotive repair and quality parts at fair prices, treating every customer the way we'd want our own families treated. Beyond fixing cars, we're building a community where people feel heard, respected, and empowered to make informed decisions about their vehicles. We succeed when our customers drive away confident, safe, and valued—not when we maximize a transaction, but when we maximize trust.</p>

  <h4>Our Vision</h4>
  <p>We envision Rylo's Automotive as more than Columbus's most trusted repair shop—we're building a movement that redefines what automotive care should be. We see a future where every person, regardless of their income or automotive knowledge, has access to honest service, quality parts, and education that empowers them. We're creating a model that proves businesses can thrive by putting people before profits, where mechanics are teachers as much as technicians, and where our success is measured in miles safely traveled and journeys made possible. We aim to expand our impact through community partnerships, educational programs, and eventually additional locations, always staying true to the handshake values that started in a Clintonville garage and were refined on America's open roads.</p>

  <h4>Why Choose Rylo's</h4>
  <p>Because your journey matters, and so does your peace of mind. At Rylo's Automotive, you'll never wonder if you're being taken advantage of. We show you exactly what's happening with your vehicle through photos and clear explanations, we quote fair prices on quality parts through our transparent online inventory system, and we treat your car like it's carrying someone we love—because it is. We're the shop where mechanics answer your questions without condescension, where estimates don't mysteriously inflate, and where your budget and timeline are respected. Founded by someone who's broken down far from home and who's watched his own family struggle with car troubles, we built this business on a simple principle: do right by people, and everything else follows. We're not just fixing cars—we're keeping your world connected, your opportunities accessible, and your adventures possible. That's the Rylo's difference.</p>
